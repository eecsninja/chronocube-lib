Contents:

  DuinoCube/  Arduino library for using DuinoCube.  In the Arduino editor, add
              this library to the Arduino environment using Sketch -> Import
              Library -> Add library.

  examples/   Sample Arduino sketches that test the various parts of DuinoCube
              as well as DuinoCube as a whole.  Use them as an example for
              writing your own apps.

  firmware/   Code that runs on the DuinoCube coprocessor.  There is no need to
              deal with this code unless you want to customize the coprocessor.
              When building, make sure to add the DuinoCube/ folder as an
              include path.

  utils/      Tools for game development with DuinoCube.  Includes programs such
              as:
                - bin2c: Converts a file's data into a C array.  No longer
                         useful for DuinoCube if you have the SD card feature.
                - bmp2raw: Converts a bitmap file to raw pixel data and palette
                           data.  Compile with EasyBMP library in third-party
                           repo.
                - tmx2dat: Converts Tiled map files (TMX) to raw tile map files.
